# About

# XCode
Learned the basics of XCode for apps and games. Developed my skills in different areas by testing several forms of apps. Proficient in most aspects of SwiftUI, and managed to inplement Firebase backend into several of my apps for login/sign up purposes. 

One app I developed is a asteroid-like game where the user shoots different weapons to destroy incoming objects. I learned how to use the physics objects that Apple provides, and how to set up levels using different functions. I implemented randomized, special power-ups that allow users to shoot to lasers at once, dealing twice the damage.
