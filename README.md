# XCode
Learned the basics of XCode apps and games. Developed my skills in different areas by testing several forms of apps. One app I developed is a asteroid-like game where the user shoots different weapons to destroy incoming objects. I learned how to use the physics objects that Apple provides, and how to set up levels using different functions.

# Sketch
Developed assets for my apps and games using sketch, learned how to make stickers for our class sticker app.
